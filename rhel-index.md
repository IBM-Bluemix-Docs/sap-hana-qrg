# Getting started tutorial

The following guidance provides an introduction for customers who are new to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} environment and would prefer a quick start format versus more detailed documentation. Two sample configurations-32 GB single-node server, and three-tier with 192 GB and 32 GB servers-help you through the ordering process to the start of the SAP installation.

The first configuration sample is the smallest one possibleâ€”a single node 32 GB RAM server; the second is an advanced configuration of two nodes, a 32 GB RAM server and a 192 GB RAM server. The disk layout might vary if you do not choose the same options in the examples. The sample layouts might not be your preferred layout; the purpose is to show you two possibilities if you are not experienced with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system. There is also an example of how to set up external storage, which can be applied to either sample configuration.
