# 2. Preparing your server for your SAP installation (192 GB)
{: #prepare_256GB}

A public IP is used for remote access, which means that you can connect to your server through an `ssh` client (for example, PuTTY on Microsoft Windows). Use the public IP address displayed in the Device List (**Classic Infrastructure** > **Devices**) for your device. The root password for your server is also displayed; be sure to click **Show Password** to see it.
